imQ is an integration platform that tries to:
  * be lightweight, easy and a pleasure to to use
  * follow REST principles
  * make simple things easy, and hard things possible

# Vision #
It will be hard to categorize ourselves as middleware, ESB, MoM, SOA, EAI platform etc. Just take a look at what we provide and make your own decision.

But we want to make it very easy (yet scalable) to build integrations. Think of it as a configurable app for EAI.

By the way, we're not bent on inventing a new middleware platform. We don't mind just using an existing one, and modifying it to our needs. The end goal is to have a solid platform that we can then enhance for use in specific industry verticals - such as insurance, mortgage, healthcare etc.
